# Tinker - Phase 3.2 âœ… COMPLETED

~~Let's add anthropic APIs. I've already have ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in .env file. However, I haven't updated any code around it.~~

~~Can you add it and make it the default agent?~~

**âœ… COMPLETED**: Anthropic Claude is now the default agent for Tinker, with full tool calling support and fallback to OpenAI when needed.

## Task List

### ðŸ”§ Core Implementation
1. âœ… **Add Anthropic dependency** - Updated `pyproject.toml` with `anthropic = "^0.40.0"`
2. âœ… **Create AnthropicToolsManager** - Converted all 6 OpenAI tools to Anthropic format
3. âœ… **Update main.py** - Added Anthropic client initialization as primary agent
4. âœ… **Create process_task_with_anthropic_tools()** - Implemented Claude's conversation flow

### ðŸ”„ Integration
5. âœ… **Agent selection logic** - Prioritizes Anthropic, falls back to OpenAI gracefully
6. âœ… **Update task analysis** - Legacy `analyze_task_with_ai()` works with both agents
7. âœ… **Test all tools** - Claude tool integration working (shell commands, file ops, email)

### ðŸ“š Final Steps
8. âœ… **Update documentation** - Added Anthropic setup notes and completion status
9. âœ… **End-to-end testing** - Phase 3.1 functionality preserved with new agent priority
10. âœ… **Clean up imports** - Code organized with proper error handling and type hints

## âœ… Implementation Summary

**Phase 3.2 has been successfully completed!** Here's what was accomplished:

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Achievements
- **Anthropic Claude Integration**: Full tool calling support with 6 core tools
- **Dual Agent Support**: Seamless fallback from Anthropic to OpenAI 
- **Backward Compatibility**: All Phase 3.1 functionality preserved
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Agent information included in task completion reports

### ðŸ”§ Technical Details
- **Tools Available**: execute_shell_command, read_file, write_file, list_directory, send_email, get_current_directory
- **Message Format**: Proper Anthropic content structure with tool result handling
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and comprehensive error reporting
- **Type Safety**: Fixed compilation errors with proper type annotations

### ðŸ“Š Files Modified
- `pyproject.toml` - Added Anthropic dependency
- `src/tinker/anthropic_tools_manager.py` - New tool manager for Claude
- `src/tinker/main.py` - Client prioritization and Anthropic integration
- `docs/phase-3.2.md` - This completion documentation

### ðŸš€ Ready for Production
The Tinker agent now uses Anthropic Claude as the primary AI with full tool calling capabilities. The system automatically falls back to OpenAI if Anthropic is unavailable, ensuring robust operation.
