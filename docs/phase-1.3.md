# Tinker - Phase 1.3

In Phase 1.2, we introduced tasks/ongoing/done folders.

In Phase 1.3, we want to give it actual ability to do some work. Let's start simple.

- [x] Tinker has read access to shell. It is able to propose shell commands. When shell commands arise. It will have to pause and gather user's input. Depending on the task, it will propose shell commands.

## Implementation Details

### Features Added:
1. **AI-Powered Task Analysis**: Uses OpenAI to analyze tasks and determine if shell commands are needed
2. **Shell Command Execution**: Can execute shell commands with proper error handling and timeout
3. **User Approval System**: Always asks for user permission before executing commands
4. **Command Editing**: Users can modify suggested commands before execution
5. **Detailed Reporting**: Creates comprehensive completion reports with command outputs
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of command failures with user choice to continue

### Safety Features:
- All shell commands require explicit user approval
- Commands can be edited before execution
- Timeouts prevent hanging processes
- Detailed logging of all command executions
- Conservative AI suggestions for command safety

### Usage:
1. Create task files in `.tinker/tasks/` folder
2. Tinker will analyze each task with AI
3. If shell commands are needed, Tinker will:
   - Show the reasoning and suggested commands
   - Ask for user approval for each command
   - Execute approved commands and capture output
   - Generate detailed completion reports
4. Tasks are moved to `.tinker/done/` with timestamped completion reports
