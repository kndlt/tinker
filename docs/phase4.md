# Tinker - Phase 1.4

In Phase 1.3, we added a feature for Tinker to interface with shell (with approval prompt). I'm not comfortable with running anything like this. Too scary. It could do `rm -rf` on things I don't want deleted.

In Phase 1.4, let's find a way to do this little more safely. When the process runs, could you run docker?

I want to do something like this.

- When tinker starts, it will start a docker container. 
- It is persistent one. So if you turn it off, it can still be brought back up next time tinker runs.
- docker instance can live within .tinker folder.

## Phase 1.4 Tasks

- [x] Research best practices for running untrusted code safely using Docker
- [x] Define the Docker image and environment for Tinker tasks
- [x] Update Tinker to start a persistent Docker container on launch
- [x] Ensure the Docker container is tied to the .tinker folder (for data persistence)
- [x] Implement logic to reuse or restart the container if it already exists
- [x] Route all shell/task execution through the Docker container
- [x] Add user documentation for Docker-based execution and safety
- [x] Test the new workflow to ensure tasks run only inside Docker
- [x] Add fallback or error handling if Docker is unavailable
- [x] Create a dedicated `.tinker/tinker/` subdirectory for all files and artifacts generated by shell commands in Docker, and mount this directory as the guest machine's home directory (`~`) inside the container. Document that this directory is the user-accessible workspace for all shell commands, and highlight that the container does NOT have access to your real home directory.
