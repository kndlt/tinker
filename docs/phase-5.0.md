# Tinker - Phase 5.0

Append some repo context information to system message.
Think about what to add. How to best represent the code base succintly but effectively.

Ideally we would utilize LLM.

One option is to do one time heavy duty code study session, and have AI agent provide a knowledge graph.

Alternatively, we can do something like AST parsing then figure out which symbols got the most reference and summarize those. We would still need to use LLM to summarize those.

I think Option 1 sounds like a most AI-native way, and I think we should do that.

I want to produce something like:

```
Repo URL: https://github.com/kndlt/pixel
Summary: 
- app: ...
  - api: ...
    - ...
  - privacy: ...
    - page.tsx: ...
  - favicon.ico: ...
  - globals.css: ...
  - layout.tsx: ...
- components: ...
  - ChatInterface.tsx: ...
  - ErrorBoundary.tsx: ...
  - Footer.tsx: ...
  - (5 others)
- docs: ...
- libs: ...
- scripts: ...
- .gitignore: ...
- README.md: ...
- next-env.d.ts: ...
...
```

If there are too many files, it would prioritize high frequency ones (whatever that means, imagine PageRank)

This requires that one file has single purpose. So, SRP design will triump here.

Alternatively for complex files, we can add in some more breakdowns AI agent thinks it would be necessary.

LLM should also note things unique to this repo.
