# Tinker - Phase 2

In Phase 1, we connected python to interface with OpenAI API at 5 second interval.

Now, in Phase 2, let's make it more interesting.

- [ ] Tinker process will pick up tasks from .tinker/tasks folder.
- [ ] While working on those tasks, it will update ./tinker/state.md.
- [ ] Once a task is done, we will move the task to ./tinker/done folder.
