# Tinker - Phase 2.1

In Phase 1.4, we created a docker container and gave Tinker shell access to it. 

In Phase 2.1, we will create user "tinker" in the container. User will be able to inspect the home directory of tinker by going into .tinker/workspace. WORK directory for tinker user will be its home directory.
