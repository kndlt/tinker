# Tinker - Phase 2.1

In Phase 1.4, we created a docker container and gave Tinker shell access to it. 

In Phase 2.1, we implemented the following improvements:

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. Created "tinker" User in Container
- Added a dedicated `tinker` user (UID 1000, GID 1000) in the Docker container
- Set up the user's home directory as `/home/tinker` 
- Granted sudo privileges to the tinker user for administrative tasks
- Container now runs as the tinker user by default for better security

### 2. Volume Mounting and Workspace Setup
- Configured volume mounting: `.tinker/workspace` (host) → `/home/tinker` (container)
- Set the container's working directory to `/home/tinker` (tinker user's home)
- Users can inspect and manage the tinker user's environment through `.tinker/workspace`

### 3. Docker Compose Migration
- Migrated from procedural Docker commands to Docker Compose for better maintainability
- Created `docker-compose.yml` with declarative service configuration
- Added `.dockerignore` for optimized build performance
- Updated `docker_manager.py` to use `docker compose` commands
- Improved container lifecycle management with automatic restart policies

### 4. Environment Configuration
- Set proper environment variables (`HOME=/home/tinker`, `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`)
- Configured container to run with appropriate user permissions
- Added common development tools (git, curl, wget, vim, nano, htop) in the container

## Technical Implementation

The tinker user's home directory (`/home/tinker`) is now mounted from the host's `.tinker/workspace` directory, allowing seamless file persistence and inspection. All shell commands executed by Tinker run within this user context, providing a clean and isolated development environment.
