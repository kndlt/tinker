# Tinker - Phase 3.1: OpenAI Function Calling Integration

Let's integrate [tools](third-party/openai/tools-api.md)

We should have tools function that will allow AI to call to execute commands inside the container.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 🛠️ Core Tools Infrastructure
- **✅ ToolsManager Class Implementation** (`src/tinker/tools_manager.py`)
  - Complete OpenAI Function Calling tools framework
  - Tool definition, execution routing, and error handling
  - Integrated with existing Docker and email systems

### 🔧 Available Tools
- **✅ execute_shell_command** - Execute shell commands in Docker container
  - Parameters: `command` (string), `reason` (string)
  - Integrated with existing `docker_manager.exec_in_container()`
  - Real-time output display with color formatting

- **✅ read_file** - Read file contents from container filesystem
  - Parameters: `file_path` (string)
  - Support for relative and absolute paths

- **✅ write_file** - Write content to files in container
  - Parameters: `file_path` (string), `content` (string), `mode` (string, default: "w")
  - Support for overwrite ("w") and append ("a") modes

- **✅ list_directory** - List directory contents
  - Parameters: `directory_path` (string, default: "."), `show_hidden` (boolean, default: false)
  - Support for showing/hiding hidden files

- **✅ send_email** - Send emails using configured SMTP
  - Parameters: `to_email` (string), `subject` (string), `body` (string)
  - Integrated with existing email_manager functionality

- **✅ get_current_directory** - Get current working directory
  - No parameters required
  - Returns current working directory in container

### 🤖 AI Integration
- **✅ process_task_with_tools Function** (`src/tinker/main.py`)
  - Complete OpenAI Function Calling workflow implementation
  - Multi-turn conversation support with tool execution
  - Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
  - Tool usage tracking and reporting

- **✅ Phase 3.1 Integration in Main Workflow**
  - Tools processing as primary method (falls back to Phase 2.x if needed)
  - Seamless integration with existing task processing pipeline
  - Detailed completion reports including tool usage statistics

### 📋 Enhanced Task Processing
- **✅ Comprehensive Tool Execution Logging**
  - Real-time display of AI tool usage
  - Detailed output formatting with colored console output
  - Tool call tracking and success/failure reporting

- **✅ Intelligent Fallback System**
  - Graceful degradation to Phase 2.x workflow if tools fail
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing task types
  - Error aggregation and reporting

### 🔄 System Integration
- **✅ Docker Container Integration**
  - All tools properly integrated with existing Docker manager
  - Commands execute in persistent container environment
  - Working directory management (/home/tinker)

- **✅ Email System Integration**
  - Tools can send emails using existing SMTP configuration
  - Maintains email task format compatibility
  - Integrated with existing email_manager functions

## 🎯 Key Features

### Advanced AI Capabilities
- **Multi-tool execution**: AI can use multiple tools in sequence to complete complex tasks
- **Contextual reasoning**: AI explains actions and provides reasoning for tool usage
- **Error handling**: Robust error detection and recovery mechanisms
- **Progressive workflow**: Supports iterative task completion with tool feedback

### Developer Experience
- **Rich console output**: Color-coded tool execution with clear status indicators
- **Detailed reporting**: Comprehensive task completion reports with tool usage statistics
- **Debugging support**: Full tool call and result logging for troubleshooting

### Safety & Security
- **Container isolation**: All tool execution happens within Docker container
- **Path validation**: Safe file operations with proper path handling
- **Error boundaries**: Graceful error handling prevents system crashes
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Maintains functionality even if tools fail

## 📊 Performance Metrics
- **Tool execution tracking**: Monitor number of tools used per task
- **Success rate monitoring**: Track tool execution success/failure rates
- **Response time logging**: Measure AI response and tool execution times
- **Resource usage**: Track container resource utilization during tool execution
